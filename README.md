# challenge1: Testimonials Grid Section 

This is my solution for the _“Testimonials Grid Section”_ challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## ✅ Project Description  
The goal of this project is to build a responsive testimonial section using HTML & CSS only. It tests layout skills using CSS Grid, responsive design, and semantic markup.

## 🎯 Features  
- A grid layout showcasing multiple testimonials.  
- CSS Grid defines different layouts for desktop and mobile viewports.  
- Each testimonial card includes:  
  - A user image  
  - Name & designation (“Verified Graduate”)  
  - A title/headline  
  - A paragraph with testimonial text  
- On smaller screens, the layout stacks and reorganizes for usability.  
- Hover or focus states (if added) for interactive feedback (optional).  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** for structure and semantic markup  
- **CSS3**, including:  
  - CSS Grid for layout  
  - Flexbox for inner elements alignment  
  - Media queries for responsiveness  
  - Box‑model, spacing, typography  
- No JavaScript required for this section  

## 📱 Responsive Design  
The layout adjusts based on screen width:  
- On desktop (larger screens) the grid shows multiple columns to display testimonials side by side.  
- On mobile/tablet viewports the grid stacks vertically and simplifies layout for better readability.
